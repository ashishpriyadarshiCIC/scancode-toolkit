<p>ALPS LIBRARY LICENSE version 1.1
Copyright (C) 2003-2005 Ian McCulloch.  Everyone is permitted to copy and
distribute this license document.</p>
<p>This License applies to any software containing a notice placed by the copyright
holder saying that it may be distributed under the terms of the ALPS Library
License version 1.1.  Such software is herein referred to as the &#8220;Library&#8221;.
This license grants permission to use, reproduce, display, distribute, execute
and transmit the Library, and to prepare derivative works of the Library, and to
permit others to do so for non-commercial academic use, all subject to the
following conditions:</p>
<p>1. In any scientific publication based wholly or in part on the Library, the use
of the Library must be acknowledged and the publications listed in the
accompanying CITATIONS.txt document must be cited.</p>
<p>2. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library in the form that
you received it, as long as all copyright notices and references to this license
and warranty disclaimer are kept intact, and all recipients also receive a copy
of this license, warranty disclaimer and CITATIONS.txt document.</p>
<p>3. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library, thus forming a work based
on the Library, and use, copy or distribute such modified works under the terms
of sections 1 and 2 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.</p>
<p>b. All citations listed in the CITATIONS.txt document that refer to
sections of the Library that exist in the modified work must be
preserved irrespective of the extent of the modification.</p>
<p>c. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
whole or in part contains or is derived from the Library or any part
thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties
under terms compatible with this License.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>4. This Software, or modifications under section 3 above, may be distributed in
object code or executable form, provided that you meet all of these conditions:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>a. This complete License, warranty disclaimer and accompanying
CITATIONS.txt document is included.</p>
<p>b. The executable program is accompanied with the complete
machine-readable source code to the Library as used in the executable,
which must be distributed under the terms of sections 2 and 3 above.
Alternatively, you may provide instructions for obtaining the source
code at no cost (for example, a hyper-text link).</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is not
a derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.</p>
<p>However, linking such a work with the Library creates an executable that is a
derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library).  The
executable is therefore covered by this License.  Section 4 states terms for
distribution of such executables.</p>
<p>6. You must cause executable programs that utilize this Library to print or
display, when started in the most basic way, a prominent announcement including
a copyright notice and citation requirements as listed in the accompanying
CITATIONS.txt document.  If the executable program utilizes the Library in a
modified form (under section 3 above), then the announcement must state this.
Exception: if the announcement would not normally be visible to the user, or
the announcement would interfere with normal operations of the executable
application, then the executable program is not required to print an
announcement.</p>

meet all of these conditions:</p>
