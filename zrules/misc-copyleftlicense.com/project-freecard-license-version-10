The FreeCard exception from the GPL

If you intend to contribute to FreeCard, you have to place your contribution 
  either under the GNU General Public License 
  (GPL) or the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). The best way to do this 
  is to add the following notice to your contribution's readme file or add it 
  as a comment to the start of any source code files you may be submitting:

 is (c) Copyright 
   by . It is free software; you can distribute it
   and/or modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
   as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of
   the License, or (at your option) any later version.
   
   As a special exception, you may
   publish an integrated combination of FreeCard in executable form
   together with your data to be displayed using FreeCard, under your
   choice of license, provided that (1) the license does not permit
   extraction of the FreeCard executable from the combination other
   than in accord with the terms of the GNU General Public License,
   that (2) you state prominently either in or with the combination
   the precise location where the complete corresponding source code
   for the same version of FreeCard is openly available on a widely
   used network, and where you can reasonably expect it to remain
   available for at least one year after you first publish the
   combination.

You will also want to add information on how to contact you by
electronic and paper mail. There are also some more things you might
want to consider, which you can find in the section on applying the
GPL to your new programs. Note that it documents how to use the GPL
without the special exception required for FreeCard source code.
