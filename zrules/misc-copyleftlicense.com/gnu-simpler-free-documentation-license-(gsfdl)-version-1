GNU Simpler Free Documentation License
Discussion Draft 1 of Version 1, 25 September 2006

THIS IS A DRAFT, NOT A PUBLISHED VERSION OF THE GNU SIMPLER FREE
DOCUMENTATION LICENSE

 Copyright (C) 2000, 2002, 2006  Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.


0. WHAT THIS LICENSE DOES

The purpose of this License is to make a work of authorship free.
This means giving all users the four essential freedoms:

  0. The freedom to read, view, or use the work.
  1. The freedom to change the work, with access to formats
     which make that convenient to do.
  2. The freedom to make and redistribute copies of the work.
  3. The freedom to distribute modified versions.
Secondarily, this License assures the author and publisher the credit
for their work, while sparing them any appearance of being responsible
for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

This License is not limited to "documentation", or even to works that
are textual; it can be used for any work of authorship meant for human
appreciation, rather than machine execution.  We recommend this
License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or
reference, but it can be used for any work regardless of the subject
matter, even for art and fiction.  The only kind of work for which
this should not be used is software.


0a. FREE MANUALS ARE ESSENTIAL

Free manuals are essential for free software.  Users must have freedom
to redistribute (including commercial sale of printed copies), so that
the manual, on-line or on paper, can accompany every copy of the
program.  When users modify the program, adding or changing features,
they must be free to update the manual too, to keep it accurate.

Although free manuals are essential, many important free programs lack
good free reference manuals and free introductory texts.  Sometimes
this is because the programs' developers wrote non-free manuals, not
recognizing the need for documentation to be free.  Please help spread
the the word that free software needs free reference manuals and free
tutorials.

You can encourage commercial publishers to publish more free manuals
and textbooks by buying printed copies of them, and by rejecting
non-free manuals.  Pay money for value, but don't pay with your freedom.

If you are writing a manual or textbook, please insist on publishing
it under a free license.  Don't let a publisher talk you out of it; if
one publisher refuses to use a free license, switch to one that will.
If you're not sure whether a proposed license is free, write to
licensing@gnu.org.


1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

  In this License, each licensee is addressed as "you," while "the
Work" refers to any work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed
by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms
of this License.  It may physically consist of multiple volumes.  A
"modified" work includes versions that have been translated,
transformed, or adapted, or to which material has been added.  A work
"based on" another work means any modified version for which
permission is necessary under applicable copyright law.

To "propagate" a work means doing anything with it that requires
permission under applicable copyright law, except making modifications
that you do not share.  Propagation includes copying, distribution
(with or without modification), making available or communicating to
the public,publicly displaying or performing the work and in some
countries other activities as well.  To "convey" a work means any kind
of propagation that enables other parties to make or receive copies,
excluding sublicensing.

A "Transparent" copy of the Work means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, that is suitable for revision straightforwardly by
generic editors appropriate to the medium (text, sound, video, etc.),
and that is suitable (perhaps through programmed format conversion) for
input to a wide variety of programs for processing that medium.
Material stored in an otherwise Transparent file format in a way that
thwarts or discourages subsequent substantial modification by others
is not Transparent.  A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
"Opaque".

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies of textual works
include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input
format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD or schema,
OpenDocument format, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript
or PDF designed for human modification.  Examples of transparent image
formats include PNG, XCF and JPG.  Examples of transparent video
formats include MPEG2 and Ogg Theora.  Opaque formats include
proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary
word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD, schema and/or
processing tools are not generally available, and the
machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

The "Title Page" means the portion of the work where information such
as title, authors, date of publication, and copyright notice would
normally appear.

A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named section of the Work whose
title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
text that translates XYZ in another language.  (Here XYZ stands for a
specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".)  To "Preserve the Title"
of such a section when you modify the Work means that it remains a
section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.

The Work may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which
states that this License applies to the Work.  These Warranty
Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this
License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other
implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has
no effect on the meaning of this License.


1a. BASIC PERMISSIONS

You have a world-wide, royalty-free license, for the duration of the
copyright on the Work, to use the Work under the conditions stated
herein.  You accept the license if you propagate the Work.


2. VERBATIM COPYING

You may propagate the Work unmodified in any medium, either commercially or
noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices,
and the license notice saying this License applies to the Work are
reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions
whatsoever to those of this License.

You need not include a copy of this License in the Work if you have
registered the work's license with a national agency that maintains a
network server through which the general public can find out its
license.

You may not apply technical measures to obstruct or control the use or
further copying of any copies you make or distribute, by those to whom
they may be distributed.  However, you may charge a fee in exchange
for copies.  You may transmit copies with methods that give you legal
rights to control further use, copying or transmission, only on
condition that you waive the use of those legal rights to impose any
conditions aside from those of this License.

You may publically perform the Work provided you make a transparent
copy of the document available as described in section 3 as though you
had propagated opaque copies to the audience.


3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
printed covers) of the Work, numbering more than 100, the front
cover must clearly and unambiguously present the full title.  Copying
with changes limited to the covers, under these conditions, can be
treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If you convey Opaque copies of the Work numbering more than 100, you
must also convey a corresponding machine-readable Transparent version.
The Transparent version need not have identical formatting as long as
its contents are the same and are clearly visible, and non-textual
contents have equal or superior resolution and quality.  When you
convey the Opaque copies by offering access to copy from a designated
place, you must offer equivalent access to copy the Transparent
version from the same place.  Otherwise, you must convey a
machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or
state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from
which the general network-using public has anonymous gratis access to
download, using public-standard network protocols, a corresponding
Transparent copy of the Work.  Under the latter option, you must take
reasonably prudent steps, when you begin conveying Opaque copies in
quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus
accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the
last time you convey an Opaque copy (directly or through your
agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Work well before conveying any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Work.


4. MODIFICATIONS

You may convey a Modified Version of the Work under the conditions of
sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version
under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the
role of the Work, thus licensing distribution and modification of the
Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.  In addition, you
must do these things in the Modified Version:

A. Use a title distinct
   from that of the Work, and from those of previous versions
   of the Work as listed in the History section.
B. List as authors (on the Title Page, if any), one or more persons or entities
   responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version.
C. Credit (on the Title Page, if any) at least five of the principal authors of
   the Work (all of them, if it has fewer than five) if the material
   derived from the Work is more than 1/4 of the total.
D. Prominently state the name of the publisher of the Modified Version.
E. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Work.
F. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
   adjacent to the other copyright notices.
G. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
   giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
   terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
I. Preserve the section Entitled "History", Preserve its Title, and add
   to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
   publisher of the Modified Version.  If
   there is no section Entitled "History" in the Work, create one
   stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Work,
   then add an item describing the Modified
   Version as stated in the previous sentence.
J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Work for
   public access to a Transparent copy of the Work, and likewise
   the network locations given in the Work for previous versions
   it was based on.  These may be placed in the "History" section.
   You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
   least four years before the Work itself.
K. For any section Entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
   Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all
   the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
   and/or dedications given therein.  Acknowledgments and Dedications
   can be deleted when a Modified Version deletes all material to
   which the Acknowledgments and Dedications could reasonably have
   applied.
L. Delete any section Entitled "Endorsements".  Such a section
   may not be included in the Modified Version.
M. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled "Endorsements".
N. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.
Authors and publishers of previous versions can release you from above
requirements to cite or refer to them or their versions.

You may add a section Entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Work do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.


5. COMBINATIONS

You may combine the Work with other works released under this License,
under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions.
Clause 4C applies to all the principal authors of all the combined
documents, taken together.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License.  In the
combination, you must preserve all warranty disclaimers, combine any
sections Entitled "History" in the various original works, forming one
section Entitled "History"; likewise combine any sections Entitled
"Acknowledgements", and any sections Entitled "Dedications".  You must
delete all sections Entitled "Endorsements".


6. COLLECTIONS

You may make a collection consisting of the Work and other works
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various works with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the works in all other respects.

You may extract one of the collected works from such a collection, and
distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
copy of this License into the extracted work, and follow this License
in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that work.


6a. EXCERPTS

You may publish a work, a Modified Version, or a collection, of up
to 20,000 characters of text (excluding formatting mark-up) in
electronic form, or up to 12 normal printed pages, or up to a minute
of audio or video, as an Excerpt.  An Excerpt follows the applicable
rules of this license, except that the following required
materials--the copy of this license, title page materials, historical
copyright notices, warranty disclaimers, and any required
sections--may be replaced by one or more publicly accessible URLs
referring to the same materials.


7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

A compilation of the Work or its derivatives with other separate and
independent works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution
medium, is called an "aggregate" if the compilation and the copyright
resulting from the compilation are not used to limit the legal rights
of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit.
Including the Work in an aggregate does not cause this License to
apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves
derivative works of the Work.


8. TRANSLATION

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Work under the terms of section 4.
You may include a translation of this License, and all the license
notices in the Work, and any Warrany Disclaimers, provided that
you also include the original English version of this License and the
original versions of those notices and disclaimers.  In case of a
disagreement between the translation and the original version of this
License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Work is Entitled "Acknowledgements",
"Dedications", or "History", the requirement (section 4) to Preserve
its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual
title.


9. TERMINATION

You may not propagate or modify the Work except as
expressly provided for under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to
do so is void.  If you violate this License, any copyright holder may
put you on notice by notifying you of the violation, by any reasonable
means, provided 60 days have not elapsed since the last violation.
Having put you on notice, the copyright holder may then terminate your
license at any time.  However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as they remain in full compliance.


10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
GNU Simpler Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
If the Work specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Work does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
