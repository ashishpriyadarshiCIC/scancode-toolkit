Libre Commons Res Communes License 

The commons is usually defined as that which is shared  communally with others. This can, for example, be a resource,  such as land or water, which is owned by the members of the  community. The commons has traditionally been limited to a  local community right and to a physical resource, such as a  forest. But it has also been used to refer to the space of  intellectual thought, ideas and concepts (e.g., 'ideas commons',  an 'innovation commons', an 'intellectual commons', a 'digital  commons', an 'e-commons', 'the public domain', 'Intellectual  Space' and so on). The Libre Commons i^e^ Communes Licence  commits the work that is inscribed with this Res Communes  license to the shared common that all can draw from and reuse. 

Licence text 

The Res Communes licence is designed to reject a state-centred  legal construct of a commons (or commons without  commonalty) in order to create a common which is shared  between us in collective practices (a rightful commons with  commonalty). 

The 'Commune' or the 'Commonalty' originally meant 'the  people of the whole realm' or 'all the King's subjects' as opposed  to the King, the Nobles or the 'Commons' in Parliament. We  here refer to the commonalty to refer to the global multitude, the  people of the whole world. 

1. This work is outside of all legal jurisdiction and takes its  force and action from the constituent radical democratic  practices of the global multitude against the logic of capital. 

2. All work that is so inscribed should bear the text '(L) 2005  Libre Commons Res Communes License'. 

3. As a user of this license the work is available to be shared and  used as part of a common substrate that is shared between us. 

To Use This License 

Simply append the following statement to your work: 

(L)  Libre Commons Res Communes License

Libre Commons Res Divini Juris License
