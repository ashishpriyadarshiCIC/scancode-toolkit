Free Art license
[ Copyleft Attitude ] Version 1.1
Preamble:
With this Free Art license, you are given the right to freely copy, distribute and transform the artworks in the respect of the rights of the author.
Far from ignoring the rights of the author, this license recognizes them and protects them. It reformulates their principle while making it possible for the public to make a creative use of the works of art. Whereas the use that is being made of the right to litterary and artistic property resulted in a restriction of the public's access to the
works of art, the goal of the Free Art license is to support it.
The intention is to open the access and to authorize the use of the resources of an artwork by the greatest number of people. To make it available in order to multiply the pleasures, to create new conditions of creation to amplify the possibilities of creation. In the respect of the authors with the recognition and the defense of their moral rights.
Indeed, with the arrival of digital creation, the invention of the Internet and of free software, a new approach of creation and of production appeared. It is also the amplification of what has been tested by many contemporary artists.
Knowledge and creation are resources which must remain free to be still truly knowledge and creation. I.e. to remain a fundamental quest which is not directly related to a concrete application. Creating is discovering the unknown, it is inventing reality without any preoccupation about realism.
Thus, the object of art is not equivalent to the artistic object, finite and defined as such. This is the essential goal of this Free Art license: promoting and protecting artistic practices freed from the rules of the market
economy.

5/ This is not all. 
 Because the use of the Free Art license is also a good way to take liberties with the system of goods generated by the dominant economy. The Free Art license offers an interesting legal framework to prevent any abusive appropriation. It is not possible any more to seize your work to short-circuit its creation and to make an exclusive profit from it. It is not allowed to take advantage of the collective work being done, not allowed to monopolize the resources of moving creation for the only benefit of some.
The Free license Art fights for an economy suitable for art, based on sharing, ex-change and the merry work. What counts in art is also and mostly what is not counted. 
 - When to use the Free Art license? 
 It is not the goal of the Free Art Licenseto eliminate the copyright or the author's rights. Quite the opposite, it is about reformulating its relevance by taking into account the contemporary environment. It is about allowing the right to freedom of movement, to free copy and to free transformation of artworks. Allowing the right to the freedom of work for art and artists. 
 1/ each time you want to use or enable this right, use the Free Art license.
2/ each time you want to create artworks so that they evolve and are freely copied, freely distributable and freely transformable:
use the Free Art license.
3/ A each time you want to have the possibility of copying, of distributing or of transforming a work: check that it is under Free Art
license. If it is not, you are likely to be outlaw. . 
 - To which types of artworks can the Free Art license be applied? 
 This license can be applied to digital artworks as well as to non digital ones. It was born out of the observation of the world of the free software and the Internet, but its applicability is not limited to the digital supports. You can put a painting, a novel, a sculpture, a drawing, a music, a poem, an installation, a video, a film, a cooking recipy, a CD-Rom, a Web site, a performance, in short all creations which can be claimed of a certain art. 
 - This license has a history: it was born at the meeting " Copyleft Attitude " http://copyleft.tsx.org which took place at "AccÃ¨s Local" and "Public" in Paris at the beginning of the year 2000. For the first time, it gathered together software specialists and actors of free software with contemporary artists and people from the art world.
