1.0   Overview

       1.1  This README file contains the latest information about
            installing the FPC firmware update.

       1.2  Limitations:

	    -  This utility is only able to update systems which can
	       be reached via an Ethernet connection. If FPC cannot be 
	       reached due to lack of a physical connection or firewall 
	       protections, then the update will fail.
	    -  Flashing back from 2.07 or newer version to 2.06 or prior version is not 
               permitted.

       1.3  Enhancements:

	    -  Refer to the change history file ibm_fw_fpc_fhet32b-3.10_anyos_noarch.chg
               for a history of enhancements and fixes.

       1.4  Recommendations and Prerequisites for the Update:

            IMPORTANT: The recommended firmware update sequence is IMM2 followed by UEFI 
            followed by DSA Preboot followed by FPC               

       1.5  Dependencies:
            - none
                 
2.0   Installation and Setup Instructions

      The procedure to update FPC is as follows:

      NOTE: In Windows Server 2008, the firewall may be enabled by default. 
            In some configurations, this could prevent the flash utility from
            succeeding.  The firewall may need to be disabled if it is suspected
            to be preventing the update traffic.
	  	  
      NOTE: Supported web browsers include 
	    IE8 (Windows 7/64-bit Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard/64-bit Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise only) or later, 
	    Firefox 27 or later, 
	    Google Chrome 30 or later.
	  
      NOTE: For increased security, only high strength ciphers are now supported on FHET24B(2.07) or later version when using https. 
	    Please follow below procedure to enable TLS1.2 or higher version on your web browser if it's not enabled by default.
			
	    For IE(v8-v10) -- Open Internet Explorer. Select "Tools" > "Internet Options". 
			      Click the "Advanced" tab, and then select the "Use TLS 1.2" check box. 
			      (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd560644%28v=WS.10%29.aspx)
			
	    For Firefox(v27) -- Open Firefox. Type "about:config" in the address bar and move pass the warning message. Search "tls". 
				Make sure "security.enable_tls" = true and "security.tls.version.max" = 3 to enable TLS1.2 support.
