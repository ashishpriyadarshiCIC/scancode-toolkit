 <p><b>Recitals</b></p>

 <p>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas Licensee has developed a prototype of a device which satisfies the Core Simputer Specifications as defined in the Simputer General Public License and has approached the Simputer Trust for a license to manufacture and distribute devices under the Simputer trademark.</p>

 <p>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Whereas the Simputer Trust has examined the Device developed by Licensee and, being convinced that the said Device meets the Core Simputer Specifications has agreed to grant Licensee the license to manufacture and distribute the Device and to use the Simputer trademark in respect of the manufacturing and distribution of the Device under and subject to the terms contained herein.</p>

 <p><b>NOW THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:</b></p>

 <p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Definitions.</p>

 <p>The following terms when used with initial letters capitalized shall, in this Agreement, have the respective meanings as set out hereunder:</p>

 <p><i>Core Simputer<sup>TM</sup></i> <i>Specifications</i> or <i>CSS</i> when used in this SGPL refers to the minimal core features that any Device must necessarily display in order that such device may be called or referred to as a Simputer<sup>TM</sup>. The Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust shall from time to time, publish the CSS on its <a href="http://www.simputer.org/">website</a> with clear version numbering.</p>

 <p><i>Device</i> means the device constructed or fabricated by Licensee using the Specifications or any modifications or derivations thereof a working prototype of which has been submitted to the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust, which Licensee has affirmed meets and satisfies the CSS and in respect of which Licensee seeks a license from the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust.</p>

 <p><i>Device Specifications</i> means the specifications, including any modifications of the Specifications, based upon which the Device was created.</p>

 <p><i>Functional Tests</i> when used in this SGPL shall refer to the set of non-invasive tests which if applied to any Device will indicate whether or not such Device satisfies the CSS. </p>

 <p><i>SGPL</i> means the Simputer General Public License as published on the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> <a href="http://www.simputer.org/">website</a>.</p>

 <p><i>Simputerised Device</i> means any device which utilizes any part, but not the whole of the Specifications or modifications thereof or which meets or achieves only a portion of the Core Simputer </i>Specifications but not all the Core Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Specifications. </p>

 <p><i>Specifications</i> means any such specifications pertaining to the hardware design, the printed circuit board layout or other works necessary for the creation of a Device as released by the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust and published on its <a href="http://www.simputer.org/">website</a>, from time to time.</p>

 <p><i>Trademark</i> means the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> trademark solely and exclusively owned by the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust.</p>

 <p><b>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Device.</b></p>

 <p>Licensee has developed the Device using the Specifications or the Device Specifications. Licensee covenants that the Device does not infringe any patent or other third party intellectual property rights. To the extent that the Device incorporates any proprietary intellectual property, Licensee has obtained appropriate and adequate third party licenses in respect of the use of those intellectual properties in the manufacture and distribution of the Device. Licensee hereby agrees to indemnify the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust and all other parties claiming under or through the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust in respect of any third party intellectual property infringement actions howsoever called in relation to the manufacture by the Licensee of the Device.</p>

 <p><b>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grant of License.</b></p>

 <p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This Agreement pertains to the license to manufacture Devices based on the Specifications or modifications of the Specifications, which meet the CSS. In order to manufacture devices based on the Specifications but which do not meet the CSS, Licensee will be required to approach the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust for a fresh license in respect thereof. </p>

 <p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust hereby grants Licensee the license to manufacture and distribute Simputers</i> subject and in accordance with the terms of the SGPL. The Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust, being the sole and absolute owner of the Trademark does hereby grant Licensee the worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable right to use the Trademark in relation to the Device, without limitation in point in time, and strictly in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions herein mentioned. The rights granted under this Agreement are personal to Licensee and cannot be assigned, transferred or otherwise dealt with except in accordance with the conditions herein contained. The license has been granted to Licensee in respect of the Device created, fabricated or manufactured in accordance with the Specifications or the Device Specifications. Nothing contained herein shall operate to grant the Licensee any rights in respect of the manufacture or distribution of any device which has been created based upon any specifications other than the Device Specifications.</p>

 <p><b>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consideration.</b></p>

The Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust covenants and affirms that the license fee represents to total consideration for the grant of the license under the terms of this Agreement and that Licensee shall not be required to pay any additional consideration or license fee in respect of the manufacture and/or distribution of the Device any subsequent version of the Device. However, the fact that Licensee shall not be required to pay any further license fee shall not absolve Licensee of the obligation to approach the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust for a license in respect of each version of the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> proposed to be manufactured and/or distributed by Licensee.</p>

 <p>4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the event License approaches the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust, under the provisions of Clause 3.1 hereof for a license to manufacture Simputerised Devices, Licensee shall not, having already paid the license fee under clause 4.1, be required to pay any additional license fee in respect of any such license that may be granted by the Simputer<sup>TM</sup> Trust. </p>

 <p><b>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Licensee Rights.</b></p>

 <p>5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Appoint sales and marketing agents and/or distributors for the Devices anywhere in the world, provided that no such appointment will hamper or restrict the right of any other licensee to appoint agents and/or distributors in the same geographical region.</p>

 <p>5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advertise the sale and marketing of the Device in any media provided that all such advertisements make reference to the Trademark in relation to the Device as well as the name of Licensee as the manufacturer of the Device.</p>
